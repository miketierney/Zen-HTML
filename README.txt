## About ##

This code is originally written (and maintained) over on [http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding. I'm just forking it for easier access (via Github), and to update some of the templates to use US English as the default encoding language (as opposed to Russian).

I will keep the bundle as up-to-date as possible, while maintaining the patches I've made to it. Changelogs are included, and will be updated along with the bundles.

## Installation ##

In the terminal:

$ cd ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/
$ git clone git://github.com/panpainter/Zen-HTML.git Zen-HTML.tmbundle

You might need to refresh your bundles in Textmate to get it to show up properly, too:

Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles


Thanks!
