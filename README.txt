This code is originally written (and maintained) over on [http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding). I'm just forking it for easier access (via Github), and to update some of the templates to use US English as the default encoding language (as opposed to Russian).

I will keep the bundles as up-to-date as possible, while maintaining the patches I've made to them. Changelogs are kept in the directories of each of the bundles.


Thanks!
Mike
